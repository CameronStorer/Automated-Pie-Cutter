Lead poisoning, also known as plumbism and saturnism, is a type of metal poisoning caused by lead in the body.[2] Symptoms may include abdominal pain, constipation, headaches, irritability, memory problems, infertility, and tingling in the hands and feet.[1] It causes almost 10% of intellectual disability of otherwise unknown cause and can result in behavioral problems.[2] Some of the effects are permanent.[2] In severe cases, anemia, seizures, coma, or death may occur.[1][2]

Exposure to lead can occur by contaminated air, water, dust, food, or consumer products.[2] Lead poisoning poses a significantly increased risk to children as they are far more likely to ingest lead indirectly by chewing on toys or other objects that are coated in lead paint.[2] The amount of lead that can be absorbed by children is also higher than that of adults. Exposure at work is a common cause of lead poisoning in adults with certain occupations at particular risk.[7] Diagnosis is typically by measurement of the blood lead level.[2] The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US) has set the upper limit for blood lead for adults at 10 µg/dl (10 µg/100 g) and for children at 3.5 µg/dl,[8] previously before October 2021 5 µg/dl[9][10] Elevated lead may also be detected by changes in red blood cells or dense lines in the bones of children as seen on X-ray.[4]
