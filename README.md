# Overview

This code was designed with intent to be executed on a rasberry pi connected to a breadboard through a GPIO interface. Using the inputs and outputs on the GPIO, this code has the ability to display a Tkinter GUI that gives a user the ability to choose how many slices they would like a pie to be cut into. Once a number is selected, a speed can also be chosen before the start button is pressed and the process begins. The Python code would then orchestrate the precise rotations of two stepper motors, one to lower a sharp blade onto the pie and another to spin the pie a specified number of degrees. This process will continue until the pie is cut in the number of slices specified by the user unless interrupted by a physically-installed safety kill switch. Each slice will be a perfect ratio and equivalent in size to every other slice.
